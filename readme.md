# ðŸ’œ sponsor

A GitHub Action that labels issues and pull requests if the creator is a sponsor, 
or belongs to an organization that is.

## Usage

```
- name: ðŸ’œ sponsor
  uses: devlooped/actions-sponsor@v1
  with:
    # The label to apply to the issue or pull request. 
    # Defaults to "sponsor ðŸ’œ".
    label: ''

    # The label to apply when sponsor amount is above the gold-amount. 
    # Defaults to "sponsor ðŸ’›".
    gold-label: ''

    # Sponsors over this amount are labeled with gold-label instead. 
    # Defaults to 100.
    gold-amount: ''

    # The account to check for sponsorship. 
    # Defaults to the repository owner `${{ github.repository.owner }}`
    sponsorable: ''

    # The token to use for querying the GitHub API for sponsorship information. 
    # Typically set to ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}.
    token: ''
```

> NOTE: in order to detect the sponsorship tier to trigger gold sponsor labeling, 
> the token must be an owner of the sponsorable organization. Otherwise, only   
> base sponsoring is detected.

## Example

Minimal example, using default labels, repo owner and gold label threshold:

```yml
name: sponsor ðŸ’œ
on: 
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  sponsor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ !endsWith(github.event.sender.login, '[bot]') && !endsWith(github.event.sender.login, 'bot') }}      
    steps:
      - name: ðŸ¤˜ checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
      - name: ðŸ’œ sponsor 
        uses: devlooped/actions-sponsor@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

> NOTE: you will typically want to skip running the workflow at all for bot accounts, hence the `if` above.

Full example overriding all values (and running on *all* issue/PR events):

```yml
name: sponsor ðŸ’œ
on: [issues, pull_request]

jobs:
  sponsor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ !endsWith(github.event.sender.login, '[bot]') && !endsWith(github.event.sender.login, 'bot') }}      
    steps:
      - name: ðŸ¤˜ checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: ðŸ’œ sponsor 
        uses: devlooped/actions-sponsor@v1
        with:
          label: sponsor
          gold-label: gold sponsor
          gold-amount: 1000
          sponsorable: moq
          token: ${{ secrets.MOQ_TOKEN }}
```

Note: the provided token must have access to retrieve sponsorships for 
the sponsorable account.
